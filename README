Installation
============

asa installation works as with any other autoconf/automake package.

   The full set ships two separate packages, asa and csri. The former
is the actual asa subtitle renderer library while csri, an acronym for
"common subtitle renderer interface" contains glue logic and helper
functions for integrating subtitle support into your application or
writing your own renderer.


asa ./configure options
=======================

`--enable-optimize'
     Enable various optimisations, both compiler-wise (-O2, -ffast-math,
     etc.) and source-wise (using SIMD assembly, if available).

     Note that you do NOT need to worry about CPU support for SIMD
     assembly code. Where SIMD assembly is used, asa checks for proper
     CPU support first. Just enable it.

`--enable-werror'
     (Intended for developers) Aborts the build on warnings.

`--prefix'
`--libdir'
     Installation destination directories. The actual asa library goes
     to (libdir)+"/csri"


csri ./configure options
========================

`--without-libass'
     Do not try to build csri wrapper for libass.

`--with-libass=path'
     Try to find libass in (path) and build the csri wrapper for it.
